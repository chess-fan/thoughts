# about this blog

I use this blog to show my thoughts on the ChessCoin project:
* it should help get things going since the project seems to have not progressed for long time (e.g. [source code](https://github.com/coinforchess/chesscoin) last updated in 2016; I am actually the first one who [reported](https://github.com/COINFORCHESS/ChessCoin/issues/1) a bug in the bug tracker; ...)

You can reply [here](https://github.com/chess-fan/thoughts/issues) (create an issue) or make a [PR](https://github.com/chess-fan/thoughts/pulls), or... just quote me on [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1510517.0) :-)

## Dec 31: prize distribution of chess tournaments (#1 and #2)
The prizes for our first ever tournament held will be soon paid out (this evening probably). The preliminary standings are:
* OnEBiGHoLE: 7500 CHESS
* ivan376: 3750 CHESS ([paid out](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1510517.msg27286158#msg27286158))
* Aegipto: 1875 CHESS

The overall winner: OnEBiGHoLE is a generous person. Why?
* He donated what he has won (7500 CHESS) back to the tournament pot
* If that is not cool, then what is ?

All info about the rules, prizes: 
* see [here](https://github.com/chess-fan/MCT/issues/14).

Preparations for tournaments #3 and #4 are ongoing [here](https://github.com/chess-fan/MCT/issues/20).


## Dec 26: we have now over 900k blocks, and I am happy that I have mined this block

Congrats everybody:
* we passed today block [#900000](https://www.blockexperts.com/chess/height/900000) in our blockchain, at: 2017-12-26 03:27:39 UTC!

And I am especially happy that I mined this block :-)

## Dec 26: calming people down; why I selected lichess; more donations please

* see [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1510517.msg26975456#msg26975456)

## Dec 25: good news: next tournaments coming; roadmap + poll review

* Good news: we've already funds for our next chess tournaments #3 and #4. Soon 2 polls about our dev situation will start! And the roadmap draft is updated more:

## Dec 25: looking back at our tournament series and our TCCT group

We've finished successfully our first tournament series:
* we have had over 60 players in both tournaments on this weekend
  * I am especially happy that in the top6 list we have longterm lichess users:
  * 50% of 'em are on lichess since at least 18 months
* the average rating of the players was around 1684
  * we had 3 players who had >2000 rating (see also the rating distribution in the picture below)
* we played in tournament #2 more games with less players
  * in average we had 1 game every minute
* our [TCCT group](https://lichess.org/team/tcct) has now 8 members with over 11000 tournament points:
  * we have strong team members: the top5 have an average blitz rating of: 1988
  * I envision that one day we can team battle other teams on lichess :-)

## Dec 24: UNHAPPY about donations

Truth be told, I am unhappy that there are no more donations:
* the only donations so far were by 1 person and these were on Dec 11 + 12

I'm wondering if the ChessCoin community actually values what I do?
* it all costs time, and time is not free
* from my impression so far: the community is not big :-(

## Dec 24: preliminary end result of our tournament series

## Dec 23: our first tournament was a big success

* see the summary [here](https://github.com/chess-fan/MCT/issues/14#issuecomment-353729613)

## Dec 13: a whale woke up

* see [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1510517.msg26245536#msg26245536)

* see [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1510517.msg26249572#msg26249572)

## Dec 12: fork situation

This can happen when e.g. there are suddenly jumps in the net weight (e.g. a whale goes online): 
* see investigation [here](https://github.com/chess-fan/MCT/issues/15)

## Dec 11: created a new website + announcement of first tournament with prizes

## 2017 Dec 10: managing tasks -> prioritize

I've created today the: [MCT](https://github.com/chess-fan/MCT) (Managing ChessCoin tasks)
* the idea is to priorize tasks, and assign them to willing people
* the other intent is that currently on bitcointalk ideas will just "disappear" over time while here people can respon to each issue directly

## 2017 Dec 10: lucky, b/c found data on archive.org for Feb 22 blockhashes

For past data I could only find for 2017 Feb 22 block hashes, see [here](https://github.com/chess-fan/blockhashes-of-ChessCoin/issues/1).
* The good thing about it is that it is independent, unmanipulatable data since it's on archive.org


## 2017 Dec 10: no uptodate synccheckpoint - for 18 months - leaves your house open for manipulation attempts + does not help newcomers in terms of sync speed

The current ChessCoin (v1.0.0.0-g32a928e) has as checkpoint only the 18-months-old genesis block #0 (from: 2016 June 5):

![cp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34405095/33800354-b02b1f50-dd3e-11e7-9aed-5d61f48e9b89.png)

Why is it good to have a checkpoint?
* at least until the new checkpoint time, the blockchain can not be manipulated anymore
* the syncing speed for new users will be better 
  * since their clients (which would have a newer checkpoint) will decline clients which are on a fork (and thus would have differing hashes)

Until the [reported bug](https://github.com/COINFORCHESS/ChessCoin/issues/1) is fixed, my bot will add current block hashes in this project (see motivation and more there) to "increase the trust" into ChessCoin's blockchain:

## 2017 Dec 9: my motivation as dev

- replying to:
 > You are exactly the right one who can build us a new wallet... (see [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1510517.msg26045773#msg26045773))
 - which came on [my statement](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1510517.msg26031156#msg26031156):
 > Part of my security analysis shows that the code base is from 2013 (the github version of 2016 is just the upload time).
Anyways, be it 2013 or 2016, when I'd want to "test" something I take the freshest codebase of bitcoin itself and not some old software where security bugs are already known for :-(

<br><br>
me:

I can do that, yes. The source is free, and can be forked anytime...
As a matter of fact, I have forked it now [here](https://github.com/chess-fan/ChessCoin_source)
* main reason for now: to have the commit comments and with that also: a backup, so the source doesn't disappear

The more important thing would be to "convince" then the majority to USE a possible "new version": e.g. exchanges, ...

And that moment would - short term at least - not be to the benefit of the coin (price goes South... or worse, e.g. coin gets delisted on the exchange(s))
e.g. exchanges would ask: 
* Why does the original dev not do this? Did he leave?
* Can we trust the new wallet, and the new dev?
* ...

But let's not forget... first the [current dev](https://github.com/COINFORCHESS) (aka: [Isolani159](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=745892)) needs to be contacted about his plans (why he did not update yet; his ongoing plans with ChessCoin; ...) before starting something that brings only negative thoughts, frustration into this all - this is surely not what we all need or want!
* see also my reply [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1510517.msg26249114#msg26249114) (>50% network support, ...)
