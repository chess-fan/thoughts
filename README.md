# about this blog

I use this "blog" to show my thoughts on the chess project:
* it should help get things going since the project seems to have not progressed for long time (e.g. [source code](https://github.com/coinforchess/chesscoin) last updated in 2016; ...)

You can reply [here](https://github.com/chess-fan/thoughts/issues) (create an issue) or make a [PR](https://github.com/chess-fan/thoughts/pulls), or... just quote me on [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1510517.0) :-)

 - which came on [my statement](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1510517.msg26031156#msg26031156):
 > Part of my security analysis shows that the code base is from 2013 (the github version of 2016 is just the upload time).
Anyways, be it 2013 or 2016, when I'd want to "test" something I take the freshest codebase of bitcoin itself and not some old software where security bugs are already known for :-(

me:

I can do that, yes (or also others). The source is free, and can be forked anytime...
As a matter of fact, I have forked it now [here](https://github.com/chess-fan/ChessCoin)
* main reason for now: to have the commit comments and with that also: a backup, so the source doesn't disappear

The more important thing would be to "convince" then the majority to USE a possible "new version": e.g. exchanges, ...

And that moment would - short term at least - not be to the benefit of the coin (price goes South... or worse, e.g. coin gets delisted on the exchange(s))
e.g. exchanges would ask: 
* why does the original dev not do this? did he leave?
* can we trust the new wallet and the new dev(s)?
* ...

But let's not forget... first the [current dev](https://github.com/COINFORCHESS) needs to be contacted about his plans (why he did not update yet; his ongoing plans with ChessCoin; ...) before starting something that brings only negative thoughts, frustration into this all - this is surely not what we all need or want!
